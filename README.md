# What

Generate a backend from a GraphQL schema, using a custom directive called `@SQL`.

# How

Resolvers are generated by parsing the schema. Annotate object descriptions on how to create a SQLite table, and fields on how to fetch them.

Simply write your schema in `schema.gql` and run `yarn start`.

# Tools

This is written using these libraries:

- better-sqlite3: a fast library for using SQLite
- graphql: the official library for parsing and printing GraphQL syntax
- apollo-server: the easiest to use GraphQL server

# Tour

This project was made to be as minimal as possible. Here are the files:

## `generate.ts`

### `getCommands`

Takes in a parsed GraphQL schema, and returns each SQL command which defines how to create an SQL table for its respective object type.

### `getResolvers`

Takes in a parsed GraphQL schema, and for each field which has a defined SQL command. Returns a resolver which executes that command using `initDb.ts/makeQuery`.

## `db.ts`

### `initDb`

Takes in a parsed GraphQL schema, and uses the aforementioned `getCommands` to execute each object's respective table.

### `makeQuery`

Takes in the name of a root, a field and a command to access that field. Returns a resolver which executes that command.

## `server.ts`

The entrypoint of the service. Parses the typeDefs, initialises the database and starts the server with the generated resolvers.
